            Koksal BABA was born in 1975 in Trabzon. BABA has a developmental
            disorder that is not seen in other members of his family and has not
            been diagnosed yet.<br />
            Baba became known especially with the sharing of videos of him
            fighting with Necati Kekeş, nicknamed Riçırt.<br />
            BABA`s videos published on the internet were watched by many
            internet users in various countries. In 2016, the Italian newspaper
            Il Primato Nazionale reported that Baba was followed by thousands of
            Italian Facebook users and that he had a Facebook page called “il
            nano ottomano”.<br />
            In April 2020, the Spanish press reported that BABA was named
            "Nadie" by Spanish internet users and that videos containing parody
            of various movements he made were published on the TikTok
            application under the hashtag #Nadie.<br />
            In 2021, WhatsApp GIFs and stickers featuring Baba reportedly spread
            in Argentina.<br />The short documentary film Koksal Baba: The Red
            Truck, directed by Koray Söğüt, about BABA life, was released in
            November 2020.<br />
